# C# Scripts for *Those Who Walk Away*

This folder contains all of the C# scripts for *Those Who Walk Away*.

The scripts are organized by their role in the overall game architecture:

### **Core Scripts**
Contains the 'manager' scripts for each app, major dialogue/data parsing systems, data containers, and a global controller that coordinates execution of the game.

### **Important Scripts**
Contains essential scripts for smaller but key systems, such as drag/drop, dialogue choice selection, the copy/paste clipboard, and manager scripts for essential prefabs.

### **Minor Fixes or Prefab Scripts**
Contains lightweight scripts for prefabs and low-maintenance systems, such as updating the time or maintaining UI elements.

**Note:**
These scripts have been 'battle-tested' and mostly work reliably, though some are still in a draft-like state. They are kept visible to demonstrate my approach to developing gameplay systems under iteration, and I am actively working on refactoring them for clarity and modularity.
